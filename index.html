            <p>These are a few examples of what you can do or pursue in game development, but there are a lot more things you can do. </p>
            <p>Furthermore, with technology advancing, there are more possibilities that are available with game development. Especially with the continue development of virtual and artificial reality. </p>
            <p>While there are many things that you can do with game development, it can be confusing to figure out where you want to start. Therefore, the best thing to do at the beginning is to figure out what you want to focus on, whether that be the more technical aspects of game development or the more artistic aspects. Choosing which area, you would like to focus on can help you figure out where you want to start. Thankfully, through the internet you can research and find tutorials to learn about whatever thing you would like.
