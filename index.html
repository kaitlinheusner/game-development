            <p>These are a few examples of what you can do or pursue in game development, but there are a lot more things you can do. </p>
            <p>Furthermore, with technology advancing, there are more possibilities that are available with game development. Especially with the continue development of virtual and artificial reality. </p>
            <p>While there are many things that you can do with game development, it can be confusing to figure out where you want to start.
