      <p>Introduction to Game Development: </p> 

      <p>In recent years, the video game industry has been growing more and more, creating many opportunities to enter the world of game development. But what does game development entail exactly? </p>

      <p>Game development refers to the process of creating video games that entertain, engage, and challenge players. It is not just about coding or graphics, it is about bringing an entire world to life. From creating an engaging narrative to designing characters, game development encompasses a wide range of skills and talents. </p> 

      <p>Game development encompasses different areas such as:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Coding</li>
        <li>Art</li>
        <li>User Interface</li>
        <li>Sound Design</li>
        <li>Storytelling</li>
        <li>Testing and Quality Assurance</li>
      </ul>
       
      <p>These are a few examples of what you can do or pursue in game development, but there are a lot more things you can do. 
        Furthermore, with technology advancing, there are more possibilities that are available with game development. Especially with the continue development of virtual and artificial reality. </p>
        
      <p>While there are many things that you can do with game development, it can be confusing to figure out where you want to start. Therefore, the best thing to do at the beginning is to figure out what you want to focus on, whether that be the more technical aspects of game development or the more artistic aspects. Choosing which area, you wouldd like to focus on can help you figure out where you want to start. Thankfully, through the internet you can research and find tutorials to learn about whatever thing you would like. Making your own small project can help allow you to get some hands-on experience and therefore permit you to learn skills and practice them along the way. </p>

      <p>Something crucial about game development is that it is a field where collaboration is key! Whether you are a programmer, writer, tester, it is important that you learn how to work with others since you all need to collaborate in order to create an engaging and fun game. </p>

      <h3>Game Engines</h3>
      <p>To start making a game, you will need to decide which game engine you would like to use to start. You might be wondering, what is a game engine?</p>
      
      <p>A game engine is a software platform that is used to build and develop video games. Game engines provide tools and pre-built systems to build and create games from scratch. Each game engine has its own unique features and tools that can help developers in different ways.</p>
      
      <p>The best three game engines are considered to be: </p>

      <ol>
      <li>1.Unity 
        Unity is one of the most used game engines. Furthermore, many professional companies will use Unity. It is a great game engine when it comes to both 2D and 3D game development. Furthermore, Unity supports multiple platforms such as iOS, Android, and PC. It uses C# as its primary scripting language. 
        
        <em>A scripting language refers to the language used to code. </em></li>
        
        <li>2.Unreal Engine
        Unreal Engine is known for its high-edge graphics. It offers both C++ scripting and a visual scripting language called Blueprints. Unreal is an incredibly effective engine to use when creating 3D games. </li>

        <li>3.Godot
        Godot is an open-source game engine that has gotten popular, especially with indie developers. It uses its own scripting language called GDScript, which is similar to Python, but it also supports C# and VisualScript for visual programming. It is good for both 2D and 3D games but is known to be great at 2D games.  </li>
      </ol>
        
      <p>These are the game engines that are considered to be the best ones to use when making games but it is up to you to decide which ones are the best for you! </p>
